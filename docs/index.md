## Our Inspiration and Initial Idea

Our project is inspired by the popular science fiction novel *The Three-Body Problem*, its plot focuses on extraterrestrial forces that are trying to destroy Earth. Our take on it, however, was not to replicate the storyline nor the idea itself but rather zoom into the people aspect of the story. In our alternate reality, humanity is left with a decision that seems to be more of a coin toss, neither end being clear. 

How would different people react to the realization that everything that they know might just collapse and be taken away based on the decision that someone will make? Some people will try to persist and fight the idea that they ever have to leave this planet. Others will turn to faith, and believe that escape is their only option. And some might just lose their minds and run around screaming. 

Our goal was to create a playable experience through which the user goes through the motions of meeting and interacting with these waves of people knowing that their futures rested on their shoulders. 

Check out our initial project proposal here: [Link](https://sparkling-nautilus-311.notion.site/Faith-in-humanity-ab99d8ba52ea4b9bb679535204325db3) 

## Finalized Story 

Note: This was the very first draft of our storyline, it is amazing looking back and seeing how much of this stuff we actually managed to build and achieve. The writing is a bit more dramatic than the game ended up being but regardless, seeing a story we wrote come to life and reflecting back on the process of creating and building it feels very good. 

Scene 1: **And From God's Cradle You Emerge.**

An inventor who has achieved many a great thing on planet Earth wakes up one day as it dawns upon her that the end is near. She looks out of her HD screen windows and feels a hopeless anger encroach upon her. She looks around for the room controller and presses the button to change what is being displayed, she is not in the mood for niceties or fake beauty. As she goes through them, she settles for the one of The Andromeda galaxy. It calms her down.  

There is a choice she must make, one that will either end her, or end everyone else. The government, the hopeful and the cynical have all placed their trust in this one singular woman, who is she, you may wonder? You. She is you. The inventor is in what people of the past may call “her prime”, she stands up and listens to a holographic message from the government. The message reminds her that she needed to make a choice. The remaining millions relied on her.

The inventor gets up, cursing the day she decided to invent her greatest accomplishment: a device that was able to detect signals from other galaxies. The entity she has been in contact with are relentless, but he does not know them.

*I must approach this with caution.* She once told herself. But what is caution when the Earth and the people you are fighting for are almost gone?

The inventor sighed and stood up, with the weight of the world on her shoulders. Unsure of what to do, she decides to leave her room.

*Two choices.*

*One Decision.*

She walks over to the teleportation dock, using the fingerprint screen, she ends up in her hallway. 

Scene 2: **Hubris Killed God in Him.**

The hallway was designed by a college friend of hers. She doesn't know where this friend is anymore, just that he is no longer alive. The story behind it is no longer important, all that it serves right now is as a reminder to all the countless meaningless achievements that the inventor has accumulated over her 36 years of life.

*To what end?* She thought to herself. *In a few days this will not matter anymore.* 

The hallway serves as a reminder, as a time-line, it was meant to immortalize her work but now, all it does is act as a reminder that no one will live to remember her or her glorified glass awards. 

Medals, Golden Cups, Ribbons, News Articles, Photographs of countless diplomatic dinners... 

*To what avail?*

*All I've done and all I've become will not matter if no one survives.*

The inventor reaches another teleportation dock, this time she chooses to go see an old friend. 

Scene 3: **This Edifice is Your Salvation.**

She is now in a lab, one that she used to work in a really long time ago. Her eyes widen in disbelief at how vacant and unkept the place appears to be. There are a few people working scattered around the area, no familiar faces around. She almost assumes the worst before she hears a voice call out to her.

"Inventor, over here." 

A high school friend of hers, Joseph, calls out to her from the back. The inventor walks over to him, relieved that at least someone she knows is alive. Her scientist friend begins to talk immediately as she gets to him, he goes on and on about new findings that could save the planet. Nano-particles, plants, soil, the inventor finds herself getting lost. 

The scientist decides to stop explaining and show her instead. They both move to a round table, the scientist starts explaining the steps, and the inventor executes them. She scoops the soil, placing it in a basin, and then pouring the chemicals from the long test tubes. 

The scientist instructs her to place it on a circular platform, where there is a light bulb that imitates the rays of the sun. 

"Watch." The scientist says. 

She squints in response trying to spot what her friend was signaling for. Her eyes widen in disbelief. 

"It's growing." She whispers. "Joseph, it's growing! A tomato plant is growing!" 

The scientist smiles and looks her in the eye. 

"You have to endorse this, inventor, you have to do this for me," He says. "I know you gave up charity work a really long time ago, but I need funding. You saw what I can do. You know what this means, right? This means you won't have to choose. We can stay here!"

**The Inventor will choose to either endorse her friend or not sometime down the line. This decision will affect the final scene.** 

The inventor leaves the lab after having made her choice. A feeling of uncertainty overwhelms her. 

*Did I make the right choice?* 

She shakes it off by reminding herself of her identity. 

*I know more than anyone does, I make the decisions.* 

*But... what if I made the wrong one?* 

Scene 4: **And this [is] the Manner of Your Release.**

The inventor is now outdoors, staring at the night sky and looking at the ruins around her. The grass is a shade of brown that she had grown to despise, the color of rotten life, the color of death. She looks around and notices the trees.

*Can I even call them trees?* 

Nothing remains. She closes her eyes and tries to imagine how it was. The colors, the liveliness, the vibrancy that came along with a stable environment. She takes a deep breath and immediately regrets it. In the midst of the coughing fit the self-induced, she hears chanting noises in the distances. 

"We shall welcome him with open arms!" 

"He who was taken up from us into heaven shall return to take us with him." 

"Look it's the false prophet!" 

*Not them...* she thinks to herself. 

The Children of Tarnara notice her almost immediately and start heading her way. As soon as they reach her they start throwing projectiles towards her. 

"Who do you think you are?" 

"You are powerless."

They are a cult of people who believe everyone except those who join them will be exterminated. Their uniform is recognizable as they wear bright yellow cloaks and masks that resemble those of plague doctors. The youngest of them approaches you with a letter. 

*You cannot defeat them. You cannot challenge them. You were the chosen one. You were supposed to rise. Now all that remains is for you to fall.* 

Before she can react, the inventor is pushed into a teleportation portal. 

Scene 5: Ending 1 → **Drown in the Fruits of Your Gluttony.**

Space ship scene. You choose to not endorse your scientist friend, you make a choice to contact the extraterrestrial entities. 

Decided to leave earth → spaceship environment, a select few people alongside the inventor are now in a spaceship towards the unknown planet they are in contact with. 

Scene 6: Ending 2 → **You are No Refuge for the Oppressed.**

The inventor chose to endorse her scientist friend and got him funding. 

Earth recovering scene. 

Recovering scene (stays on earth) → trees growing, clear sky



## Process of Building the Scenes

Our project has 7 scenes in total, each scene is crucial to the story line! 

### Scene 0 - The Loading Screen 

Honorable mention. This is part of the XR screen and it's appears in between loading/unloading scenes in order to not have the user trapped in complete darkness. 


### Scene 1 - The Lobby 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=14S5KHsocPyrCl7GdYa0iaVq8ZkZoJedZ)

**Background**
The inventor wakes up here. This scene has a futuristic setting, cool colors reflect the personality and status of the inventor. After a short period of time a message plays in which the inventor receives a message from the government. In this room are several things that are crucial to the story, some of which include: posters on the wall for context, books and newspaper the user may choose to hold and read (context on what is happening outside). There is also a TV that is playing a video compilation of natural disasters. 

**Interactions Sequence**
    - The user wakes up on the bed, for a few seconds they can move around, explore their setting
    - A message starts and the button on the table starts blinking
    - Once you push the button, a holograph message starts playing (talking animation) and when it's done, the animation stops and a dialogue controller option appears 
    - User makes a choice, the other option disappears and the main character speaks
    - The holograph responds, then by an internal monologue the user is prompted to go into the teleporter (also it blinks to make it more attractive for the user to walk through)


**Implementation**
The blinking of the button stops as soon as a boolean variable wasPressed turns true. This triggers the holograph message and starts a coroutine that waits for the audio to be over before setting on the dialogue controller (a canvas). Once the user presses a button on the canvas, a boolean called choice made triggers the main character's response, waits for it to be over and starts the hologram's second part (response to user response), it waits for that message to be over before setting the hologram character inactive. There were some issues in this scene with where to call what since at points audio was being called every frame which meant it wasn't being heard. Debugging this scene was a lot of fun! 


### Scene 2 - The Corridor 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WgtXSW0XS11F_2-vwS9b12Hk_KxbfAp6)

**Background**

In the corridor, the inventor is faced with her past. The corridor consists of holographic panels that the inventor encounters, she stands and contemplates over the things that got her to where she is today. The player here is meant to be given as much context as possible in order for them to grasp the kind of person they are in this reality. They are someone important, but beyond that, they have an important choice to make. 

**Interactions Sequence**
  
    - Blinking Anchors
    - Once the user is at an anchor, they are able to listen to an internal monologue, while reading an insight about the inventor's life on the hologram 
    - The user moves on from one hologram to the next until they reach the lab. 

**Implementation**
Implementation here was not difficult, the anchors were the triggers that detected collision between their colliders and the collider on the right hand. That detection triggers an audio source, followed by a countdown timer to make the current hologram disappear and the next one appear. Note that anchors disappear immediately as soon as a user steps on them. This is to avoid multiple collisions which could lead to the internal monologue playing more than once.

The Audio plays immediately onTriggerEnter and calls this coroutine straight afterwards. (Code snippet from script HolographCorridorController.cs)

```markdown

     IEnumerator SetThingsRight()
    {
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(McTalk.clip.length); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(15);
        Debug.Log("I am in the coroutine");
        Holograph.SetActive(false);
        mySelf.SetActive(false);
        nextSelf.SetActive(true);
        nextHolograph.SetActive(true);


    }

```

### Scene 3 - The Lab 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1m6hgPpJP3Wz2z-X9wUys8o5UL30rVarJ)

**Background**

the lab scene is the inventor's first encounter with one group of interest — the scientists. The inventor would be greeted by the representative of the scientist group - Joseph, who is also her friend. Joseph would show the hyper-growth concept to the inventor in an attempt to persuade the inventor into supporting the scientists. 

**Interactions Sequence**

    - Greeted by Joseph: when the inventor enters the lab, Joseph would come over and greet her
    - Follow Joseph and see him talking: after greeting, Joseph would ask the user to follow him over to the lab table. When the user comes, Joseph would introduce her to the concept of hyper-growth.
    - Pour the bottle: Joseph would instruct the inventor to pick up the yellow bottle on the table and pour it inside the blue container on the robot's hand.
    - See the plant grow: after the inventor successfully pours into the blue container, the inventor would see a pump transferring the yellow chemicals into the tube, and the plant will grow.
    - Respond to Joseph: after the inventor sees the plant growing quickly, Joseph will ask her if such an effect has changed her mind. Then a UI would appear asking the inventor to respond (has two options). Joseph would respond accordingly.
    - Leave the lab: the inventor received enough information and would like to take a walk outside to clear her head. Joseph would say goodbye to her and the inventor would go to the teleport portal and teleport to the outside world.


**Implementation**

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RoAgrhXLfzmQxL8BRFg9bKvRDYzwz5n0)

### Scene 4 - The Outside 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CyNfU4XIZJa50jO-hs9HA9jNZ56W6P14)

**Background**

The outside scene is where the inventor encounters another two groups of people who hold vastly different opinions about the right choice about humankinds' fate. One group is the panicked crowd, who would be running around, shouting or sighing in response to the desperate situation of the Earth. The inventor would see them, but won't interact with them. Another group is the cult, who worship the unknown extraterrestrials, regarding them more as gods who would save humans. The cult would see the inventor and come to her to persuade her into trusting and contacting the aliens. The cult also hate the inventor because the inventor, who herself is also a scientist, is involved in the process of high-tech development at the expense of resources depletion.


**Interactions Sequence**

    - The inventor teleports to the outside area and sees people running and shouting around
    - Three cults notice the inventor and run to her in sequence
    - Three cults start talking to the inventor one after another
    - After they finish talking, run back to their original place and start praying again
    
**Implementation**

### Scene 5 - The Lobby Again

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZRpoB4zOZKtM-iv7nwyNcuELW4un6mDe)

**Background**

In this scene the inventor comes back to the lobby for the final decision. 
**Interactions Sequence**
  
    - The button is flashing and ringing for the inventor to press
    - Once the inventor presses it, the holograms start appearing with a final message. The holograms are all the people the inventor has met before. 
    - The order they appear in is as follows: Government Official -> Joseph -> Cult Member 
    - Once the Messages are done playing, the characters disappear and the dialogue screen appears. The user makes their choice. 
    
**Implementation**

There is no teleportation area, the user is stuck on an anchor in front of the table. The dialogue action and the animation of the characters was pretty similar to the first scene, except here we used nested coroutines to trigger the character's messages in order, one after the next. As soon as the button gets pressed by the user, the following coroutine is triggered (snippet from HologramControllerFinal.cs): 

```markdown

    public void PlayMyCoroutines(){ 
        StartCoroutine(GovFinalMessage());
        // StartCoroutine(GovFinalMessage()); 
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    IEnumerator CultFinalMessage(){ 
        Cult.SetActive(true); 
        CultAudio.Play(); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(CultAudio.clip.length); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(1); 
        Cult.SetActive(false);
        DialogueController.SetActive(true);


    }

    IEnumerator GovFinalMessage(){ 
        Government.SetActive(true); 
        GovernmentAudio.Play(); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(GovernmentAudio.clip.length); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(1); 
        Government.SetActive(false); 
        StartCoroutine(ScientistFinalMessage()); 

    }

    IEnumerator ScientistFinalMessage(){ 
        Scientist.SetActive(true); 
        ScientistAudio.Play(); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(ScientistAudio.clip.length); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(1); 
        Scientist.SetActive(false);
        StartCoroutine(CultFinalMessage());

    }

```

### Scene 6 - Spaceship Ending 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Z35ihd7PlEjm6Gb4d_rj6vGLfdFL3Hu0)

**Background**

The user ends up here if they choose to contact the aliens instead of staying on earth. 

**Interactions Sequence**

There are no interactions here, just a teleportation area and inner-monologue that plays, followed by a defined period of silence before the application quits. 

**Implementation**

This is the code that powers the ending scenes. Very simple, but also very effective at doing the job! Code snippet from QuitGame.cs
```markdown 

public class QuitGame : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource LastLine; 
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(LetMeBreathe()); 
        StartCoroutine(GoodbyeBois());
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    IEnumerator GoodbyeBois(){ 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(30); 
        Application.Quit(); 

    }
    IEnumerator LetMeBreathe(){ 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(6); 
        LastLine.Play(); 
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(LastLine.clip.length); 
        


    }

    
}

```

### Scene 7 - Outside Ending 


![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1G_fs_XQK9gbGLjTQVhNKp25OjR5LnvGQ)

**Background**

The user ends up here if they choose to stay on earth. This scene visually is very similar to the outside scene except the music is more hopeful and the sky is blue, and more welcoming. 

**Interactions Sequence**

There are no interactions here, just a teleportation area and inner-monologue that plays, followed by a defined period of silence before the application quits. 

**Implementation**

Exactly the same as scene six :> 

## Visuals 
The aesthetic of our game aimed to revolve around a voxel world, where the environment is pixelated and objects are in remote resemblance to Minecraft.
To achieve this, the work was broken down into several parts.
First, finding the corresponding inspiration. Voxel art seems to be a growing trend in the 3D art community lately, and it consequently was easy to find good looking references on Behance to get a feel for how voxel spaces could look like in VR. More specifically, we took inspiration from some of the works from [this artist on Behance](https://www.behance.net/joannan/).

Our voxel scenes were made with VoxelMax, an iPad app. This process quickly turned out to be meticulous, as each block mattered, and there were considerably less geometric guidance compared to other apps like Shapr3D. However, using voxels instantly gave each asset a unique gamy-feel, which ensured that things could be brought together in cohesion. Here are a few timelapses of the assets making: [Corridor scene](https://youtu.be/r7x9g2Irfsc)  |  [Lab scene](https://youtu.be/rpq_jVUein4)  |  [Space ship scene](https://youtu.be/ReEonKyajRU)


Alongside with handmade assets, we decided to also make our own characters. For that we used Blender, which turned out to be a somewhat convenient 3D asset making tool. We followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/tzt55UfljGA) to make a smooth-looking and minimal character. Once completed, it served as the foundation for other characters used in the whole game. [Here is a timelapse of how the character was made](https://youtu.be/hHOI7UXdkbA).

In reflecting on the Blender experience, a few things immediately come to mind. There was a lot to learn about the concept of vertices and how it is used to create shapes in 3D. So far, going from Shapr3D to voxels, Blender provides the best way to work with forms, and its versatility in both allowing the important and export of a variety of 3D files made a huge impact in our project workflow. But all this did not come without a cost. While it is easy to make smooth shapes in Blender, it is important to keep an eye on the statistics. At the end of our project, we realized that each character had over 200,000 vertices, which created a number of issues when rendering our project in VR. Learning from mistakes, this is definitely a crucial outcome in the asset making experience.

Developing a bit on the visuals of each character, we decided to keep things straightforward. The hologram in the first scene was a female version of the very first character we made. It does not feature any special clothing, although it was somewhat challenging to create longer hair, as it is depicted in the time-lapse below. All other characters representing the cult feature a coat also made from scratch in Blender. It was made thanks to [this four part tutorial](https://youtu.be/tOCSOWOvn9Y), which complemented nicely the expansion of our asset making skills, now featuring clothes making. [Here is a timelapse of it](https://youtu.be/4m-w6CsJbNI).

Holograph man: Good morning Inventor, do you hear me? I am an informant from the Ministry of Defense. We know you haven't been feeling well, but have you made up your mind on what to do? Are we to go with the extraterrestrials or wait for the scientists to help us out?

**CHOICE:**

Character: I haven't, I am still not sure which direction is the one I should go with.

Character: It does not matter to me, as long as some of us are able to survive.

H.M.: We need to know. We need to prepare. Let us know as soon as you do. The future of mankind lies with you. Everyone's lives are hanging on this. Everyone's.

We remain waiting for you. Don't let us down.

**Internal Monologue[sighs]:** Let me head to the lab, I need to see Joseph.

---

**Scene 2: Corridor**

Sounds: 
- Sad nostalgic music

This is all main character inner monologue. 

1st Panel → I remember this. Life was so much simpler back then. 

2nd Panel → Ah yes, who could forget? The amazing inventor, I thought I could change the world. 

3rd Panel → Will my invention kill us, or will it save us from the horrors of this world? I do not know.

4th Panel → And so, the choice is now mine, the lab should be just ahead. 

---

**Scene 3: Lab**

Sounds: 

- Background Lab noises (we only have one scientist so probably no)

Joseph: Hello inventor! Thank you for making time to see me. I know the situation is pretty messy... The Earth is almost void of its resources, people are in panic, and that crazy cult is not making it any easier for you to choose which way to go.  

Joseph: But listen, all hope is not lost. Science can still save us. Follow me, I want to show you something that we have been working on recently. 

*[Walk to the plant position]*

- IF user not coming over:
    
    Joseph1: Please follow me.  
    
    Joseph2: Did you hear me? I'm here.
    

Joseph: Do you remember the hyper-growth concept I presented once at that conference? Well, It's not just a concept anymore. Please look at this.

Joseph: This is the latest progress we've had with our development. That bottle over there, that yellow substance inside it is the heart of it all. I think you should try it for yourself.  

Joseph: Do you see the yellow bottle on the table? Pick up it and pour it inside the blue container beside you. And the robot hand will do the rest for you.

- Pouring interactions
    
    Joseph1: No not this one, it's the yellow one
    
    Joseph2: Yes, the right bottle. Please pour it into the blue container beside you. 
    
    Joseph3: What are you doing? Please pour it into the blue container.
    
    Joseph4: See the blue container on the lower part of the robot hand? That's where you should pour.
    
    Joseph5: Yes, right place. Pour in the blue container and see how the tube beside you goes.
    

[Pouring interaction]

Joseph: Did you see? Does this sway your decision at all? 

CHOICE

Response1: This does call for more enthusiasm I have to be honest. 

Response2: We still don't know how many people this can save if it can save anyone at all. 

CHARACTER REACTION

Joseph: It really does, there is still hope to save our planet. 

Joseph: I understand your concern. But is there any certainty whoever you're contacting...these aliens, there is a huge possibility they just kill us all. 

Main Character**:** I think I need to clear my head, I'll go take a walk outside. I will reconsider everything. See you soon, Joseph. 

Joseph: Alright, watch out for the Cult

**Decision Scene**

Joseph: We can do this. Have faith. Inventor we should do what it takes to save our home. 

---

**Scene4: Outside**

Sounds: 

- People screaming
- Weird Chants
- Weird Scary Music
- Spaceship decision - with response if possible

Cult Member 1: Look who it is! Our great inventor! Thank you for finally gracing us! It is finally your time to shine. Everything you have worked for. Call upon the divine ones to rescue us. 

Cult Member 2: Hey inventor look here! Look how far science has brought us! We'll all die before science comes up with anything to save yes! Call upon them! 

Cult Member 3:  The divine will come and they shall rescue us! Make the right choice. Save us! Future generations will hail you as our savior. 

Cult Member 1: Please make your choice as soon as possible. The divine can't wait that long.

**Internal Monologue:**  

I need to clear my head. My room... I need to go back to my room. 

[Scene transitions back to scene 1 where the inventor has to make her choice] 

Final Decision Scene

Cult member: what are you hesitating for? Scientists are always doing bad things. Only the divine could save us!

**Scene 5 and 6**

Main Character [Pondering]: 

Scene 5→ Was this the right choice? I wonder what will happen to us all. Still, some of us are here, that should be good enough for me. 

Scene 6 → And so on our Earth we remain. This is the safest bet, I will work with Joseph to make this place better for us all. My goal is to hand everyone a better future and not just a select few.

```

### NonHuman Audio: Background Music and co. 


**Background music**

We experimented with different background music (royalty free) for each scene. 

Here is what we achieved! 

Lobby -> Ambient Music, Calm

Corridor -> Invoke emotion, nostalgia 

Lab -> Calm, Also Ambient (same as lobby)

Outside -> Epic, but unsettling tracks 

Endings: 
- Outside Ending: Hopeful music 
- Spaceship Ending: Calm yet uncertain, music that evokes the feeling of going on a journey with no end destination 




## Playtesting 

We got a few of our classmates to playtest and based on that we refined and further improved our project. Here's more on what that process was like. I would like to state that this was a pretty fun experience! Note that playtesting was done when we had 3 scenes half built. Those three scenes are the Lobby, Corridor and the Lab. The basic interactions had been set up but everything at this point of the project was still pretty janky and needed bob the builder (we fixed it ;>). 

### Playtester: Professor

Citizen Kane → Newspaper montage.
**Feedback for the Corridor**
- Disappearing/Appearing and have a laser sound (scale up, flash on), move towards you
- Ray-cast on the holographs in the corridor, >> 

### Playtester: Rainee 

Miss Rainee stated that "The vibe check has been passed". This alludes to the aesthetics of the project being successful in portraying a science fiction setting.  

**Feedback for the Corridor**
- The shader of the holographs in the corridor makes it hard to read the text and see the picture. 
- Hand Guide, left hand teleport-er, right hand

**Feedback for the Lab**

- Guiding the user around needs to work just a little bit better 
- Joseph's voice needs to be higher 
- Make him pause before telling us to play around by ourselves 
- Fix the textures 

### Playtester: Ons 

- Door how to open
- Corridor goes away too fast
- Fixing how the doctor acts basically
- XR scene fix
- More time to read

### Playtester: Marta 

- More time to read
- Shader
- Fix the light in the lobby
- Make it more clear to user the ray-cast for the holograms


### Takeaways and Reflection 

We ended up taking much of the feedback given on playtesting day and rolling with it! The professor's suggestion for the corridor were implemented, as well as longer time for the holographs from Ons. We also drastically changed the way the scientist acted, and the issue with his voice being too low disappeared once we had our human voice actor's lines! 

## Challenges 

Here are some of the challenges that we faced while working on this project. To say there were more than a few is an understatement.

### Technical Challenges
Our project is animation and interaction heavy. The hard part is not only about the detailed scripting logic, but also about linking everything together (animation, scripts, shaders, particles, etc). There are many details in each step that would require logics and systematic thinking to keep track of everything. Also, the Awake(), Start(), Update() and Coroutines should be considered carefully before using them because they're directly related to the frames and would directly impact the visual effects. 

Take the pouring interaction and plant growing animation as an example. The steps are explained in detail as follows:

There are actually far more details than described above, like how much/fast the particles move, how to make the particles move within a certain boundary and when to kill them. Also, whether to update the animation in Update() or in a Coroutine would also impact the visual effects. There are a lot of detailed manipulations about the parameters to make them work as a whole. We also had a lot of issues with small missing elements or steps that would take us HOURS to figure out (ie. accidentally deleting a rigid body).

Another technical challenge we ran into was related to our characters. We had character that we would've loved to use but because of how high-poly they were, they destroyed the oculus' performance causing us to have to choose to let them go. 

One last one to mention was implementing the dialogue, we did waste a week trying to integrate ink, when going with a much more simpler hardcoded option was more than sufficient enough for our project.

### Expecting User Behavior

Following the previous section, there are also challenges about expecting user behavior. For example, in the lab scene, there are many expected behaviors that users may not necessarily follow. Another mind-map to show the problems and solutions:

The detailed expectations of possible user behavior and proper limitation/intervention could protect the whole user experience without breaking the fourth wall.

### Storytelling Challenges 

Our project was a very ambitious one, totally at 7 scenes that the user experiences. The challenges appeared soon after, when we realized the considerable amount of work that we had to pour into each scene to make it work in the grander scheme of the tale itself. We had to find a way to deliver a playable experience to the users taking into account our time and skill restraints. The user initially was meant to feel small and hopeless, not knowing what to decide. Instead we twisted in a way that would form a more empowered user, one that is aware of what is happening and confident of the power that they are given. Our focus shifted to have the player listen to all the different voices before making the decision. When the time comes, the user sees those same voices, reminded of the weight of the situation and that the choice is not only affecting them, but many others as well. 
A compromise we had to make lies in the fact that our original characters were a bit too much for the oculus to handle (we ran into a performance issue), this made us decide to lower the amount of NPCs that we have, only keeping those that were crucial to the story line. In the outside scene for example (we would have loved to have more screaming people), we had to significantly reduce the crowd size. 
Another storytelling challenge also came with the two ending scenes, we already had built so many interactions so the question was: do we add more interactions? or do we leave space for the user to contemplate? We chose the latter, due to the lack of time and to try to have open ended scenes where the user can find themselves imagining what the consequences of their choices will be. 

## Reflection and Final Thoughts

### What Was
The project was a success on demo day! The professor was able to run through six scenes (he had to make one choice) smoothly and the experience seems to have the effect that we hoped it would. Our user is presented with a moral dilemma that they must follow through with and choose. Neutrality was never an option hehe. Given the time limit, division of work, technical difficulties, and the giant content of the project itself, we think have successfully achieved the storytelling, world-building, and interactions requirements. The story is a complete and playable one, and the animations, sound, and interactions are well integrated to ensure an immersive experience. The expectations of user behavior are also well manipulated to guarantee the fourth wall experience.

While we have tried our best to achieve the best possible project within the short time limit, there's still much to improve to enhance the user experience. 

### What Could Have Been
Things we would've implemented if we had more time: 

1. More autonomous agents and background storytelling: our visuals, for now, are  simple, there are so many details that could be added to enhance our world-building. Also for the NPCs, the world would be more more lively if there were more NPCs from various groups of interests trying to persuade the user into a certain decision.
2. More about the ending scenes: due to the time limit we leave the ending scenes up to the user's imagination. But if we build more about the ending scenes the story would be more dramatic. 
3. More sound effects: sounds could play a large role in storytelling. Footsteps, the wind, rain were all things we could've worked into the project but ultimately decided not to due to time. 

### Overall Thoughts

A lot was learned about unity in this project, we achieved so many things that we probably would've found very difficult (probably impossible) on our first day in this class. Unity is a powerful tool that we will probably keep using in our future projects! Aside from technical aspects, implementing visuals and working on patching together 3D environments that users will actually be transported into has been... an experience (real life metrics do matter, can't have things looking too big or small if it's not VR Alice in Wonderland)! Overall what we've learned from this is that it takes a village to raise a video game experience into something playable. The joy was in the journey but it feels really nice to finally arrive at the destination and put down our metaverse hats! Cheers! <3 :>

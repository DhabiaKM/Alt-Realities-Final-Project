## Our Inspiration and Initial Idea

Our project is inspired by the popular science fiction novel *The Three-Body Problem*, its plot focuses on extraterrestrial forces that are trying to destroy Earth. Our take on it, however, was not to replicate the storyline nor the idea itself but rather zoom into the people aspect of the story. In our alternate reality, humanity is faced with an extreme 

How would different people react to the realization that everything that they once knew might just collapse? Some people will try to persist and fight the idea that 

We didn't replicate that story, rather we found that people's different reactions to doomsday interesting. Some people are calm and trying to find solutions, some people are in panic and some people are even worshiping the aliens. To dramatize the story, we want to showcase various interests of the group and present to the user the important decision to make that would determine the fate of humankind. 

## Finalized Story 


Scene 1: **And From God's Cradle You Emerge.**

An inventor who has achieved many a great thing on planet Earth wakes up one day as it dawns upon him that the end is near. He looks out of his HD screen windows and feels a hopeless anger encroach upon him. He looks around for the room controller and presses the button to change what is being displayed, he is not in the mood for niceties or fake beauty. As he goes through them, he settles for the one of The Andromeda galaxy. It calms him down.  

There is a choice he must make, one that will either end him, or end everyone else. The government, the hopeful and the cynical have all placed their trust in this one singular man, who is he, you may wonder? You. He is you. The inventor is in what people of the past may call “his prime”, he stands up and listens to a holographic message from the government. The message reminded him that he needed to make a choice. The remaining millions relied on him.

The inventor gets up, cursing the day he decided to invent his greatest accomplishment: a device that was able to detect signals from other galaxies. The entity he has been in contact with are relentless, but he does not know them.

*I must approach this with caution.* He once told himself. But what is caution when the Earth and the people you are fighting for are almost gone?

The inventor sighed and stood up, with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Unsure of what to do, he decides to leave his room.

*Two choices.*

*One Decision.*

He walks over to the teleportation dock, using the fingerprint screen, he ends up in his hallway. 

Scene 2: **Hubris Killed God in Him.**

The hallway was designed by a college friend of his. He doesn't know where this friend is anymore, just that he is no longer alive. The story behind it is no longer important, all that it serves right now is as a reminder to all the countless meaningless achievements that the inventor has accumulated over his 36 years of life.

*To what end?* He thought to himself. *In a few days this will not matter anymore.* 

The hallway serves as a reminder, as a time-line, it was meant to immortalize his work but now, all it does is act as a reminder that no one will live to remember him or his glorifies glass awards. 

Medals, Golden Cups, Ribbons, News Articles, Photographs of countless diplomatic dinners... 

*To what avail?*

*All I've done and all I've become will not matter if no one survives.*

The inventor reaches another teleportation dock, this time he chooses to go see an old friend. 

Scene 3: **This Edifice is Your Salvation.**

He is now in a lab, one that he used to work in a really long time ago. His eyes widen in disbelief at how vacant and unkept the place appears to be. There are a few people working scattered around the area, no familiar faces around. He almost assumes the worst before he hears a voice call out to him.

"NAME, over here." 

A high school friend of his, Dr. NAME2, calls out to him from the back. The inventor walks over to him, relieved that at least someone is alive. His scientist friend begins to talk immediately as he gets to him, he goes on and on about new findings that could save the planet. Nanoparticles, plants, soil, the inventor finds himself getting lost. 

The scientist decides to stop explaining and show him instead. They both move to a round table, the scientist starts explaining the step, and the inventor executes them. He scoops the soil, placing it in a basin, and then pouring the chemicals from the long test tubes. 

The scientist instructs him to place it on a circular platform, where there is a light bulb that imitates the rays of the sun. 

"Watch." The scientist says. 

He squints in response trying to spot what his friend was signaling for. His eyes widen in disbelief. 

"It's growing." He whispers. "NAME2, it's growing! A tomato plant is growing!" 

The scientist smiles and looks him in the eye. 

"You have to endorse this, Name, you have to do this for me," He says. "I know you gave up charity work a really long time ago, but I need funding. You saw what I can do. You know what this means, right? This means you won't have to choose. We can stay here!"

**The Inventor chooses to either endorse his friend or not. This decision will affect the final scene.** 

The inventor leaves the lab after having made his choice. A feeling of uncertainty overwhelms him. 

*Did I make the right choice?* 

He shakes it off by reminding himself of his identity. 

*I know more than anyone does, I make the decisions.* 

*But... what if I made the wrong one?* 

Scene 4: **And this [is] the Manner of Your Release.**

The inventor is now outdoors, staring at the night sky and looking at the ruins around him. The grass is a shade of brown that he had grown to despise, the color of rotten life, the color of death. He looks around and notices the trees.

*Can I even call them trees?* 

Nothing remains. He closes his eyes and tries to imagine how it was. The colors, the liveliness, the vibrancy that came along with a stable environment. He takes a deep breath and immediately regrets it. In the midst of the coughing fit he self-induced, he hears chanting noises in the distances. 

"We shall welcome him with open arms!" 

"He who was taken up from us into heaven shall return to take us with him." 

"Look it's the false prophet!" 

*Not them...* 

The Children of Tarnara notice him almost immediately and start heading his way. As soon as they reach him they start throwing projectiles towards him. 

"Who do you think you are?" 

"You are powerless."

They are a cult of people who believe everyone except those who join them will be exterminated. Their uniform is recognizable as they wear bright yellow cloaks and masks that resemble those of plague doctors. The youngest of them approaches you with a letter. 

*You cannot defeat them. You cannot challenge them. You were the chosen one. You were supposed to rise. Now all that remains is for you to fall.* 

Before he can react, the inventor is pushed into a teleportation portal. 

Scene 5: Ending 1 → **Drown in the Fruits of Your Gluttony.**

Space ship scene. To be Written. 

The inventor chose not to endorse his scientist friend, he makes a choice to contact the extraterrestrial entities or not here. 

Decided to leave earth → space environment

Scene 6: Ending 2 → **You are No Refuge for the Oppressed.**

The inventor chose to endorse his scientist friend and got him funding. 

Earth recovering scene. To be Written. 

Recovering scene (stays on earth) → trees growing




## Process of Building the Scenes

Our project has 7 scenes in total, each scene is crucial to the 


### Scene 1 - The Lobby

### Scene 2 - The Corridor 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WgtXSW0XS11F_2-vwS9b12Hk_KxbfAp6)

**Background**

In the corridor, the inventor is faced with her past. The corridor consists of holographic panels that the inventor encounters, she stands and contemplates over the things that got her to where she is today. The player here is meant to be given as much context as possible in order for them to grasp the kind of person they are in this reality. They are someone important, but beyond that, they have an important choice to make.

### Scene 3 - The Lab 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1m6hgPpJP3Wz2z-X9wUys8o5UL30rVarJ)

**Background**

the lab scene is the inventor's first encounter with one group of interest — the scientists. The inventor would be greeted by the representative of the scientist group - Joseph, who is also her friend. Joseph would show the hyper-growth concept to the inventor in an attempt to persuade the inventor into supporting the scientists. 

**Interactions Sequence**

    - Greeted by Joseph: when the inventor enters the lab, Joseph would come over and greet her
    - Follow Joseph and see him talking: after greeting, Joseph would ask the user to follow him over to the lab table. When the user comes, Joseph would introduce her to the concept of hypergrowth.
    - Pour the bottle: Joseph would instruct the inventor to pick up the yellow bottle on the table and pour it inside the blue container on the robot's hand.
    - See the plant grow: after the inventor successfully pours into the blue container, the inventor would see a pump transferring the yellow chemicals into the tube, and the plant will grow.
    - Respond to Joseph: after the inventor sees the plant growing quickly, Joseph will ask her if such an effect has changed her mind. Then a UI would appear asking the inventor to respond (has two options). Joseph would respond accordingly.
    - Leave the lab: the inventor received enough information and would like to take a walk outside to clear her head. Joseph would say goodbye to her and the inventor would go to the teleport portal and teleport to the outside world.

### Scene 4 - The Outside 

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CyNfU4XIZJa50jO-hs9HA9jNZ56W6P14)

**Background**

The outside scene is where the inventor encounters another two groups of people who hold vastly different opinions about the right choice about humankinds' fate. One group is the panicked crowd, who would be running around, shouting or sighing in response to the desperate situation of the Earth. The inventor would see them, but won't interact with them. Another group is the cult, who worship the unknown extraterrestrials, regarding them more as gods who would save humans. The cult would see the inventor and come to her to persuade her into trusting and contacting the aliens. The cult also hate the inventor because the inventor, who herself is also a scientist, is involved in the process of high-tech development at the expense of resources depletion.


**Interactions Sequence**

    - The inventor teleports to the outside area and sees people running and shouting around
    - Three cults notice the inventor and run to her in sequence
    - Three cults start talking to the inventor one after another
    - After they finish talking, run back to their original place and start praying again

## Visuals 
The aesthetic of our game aimed to revolve around a voxel world, where the environment is pixelated and objects are in remote resemblance to Minecraft.
To achieve this, the work was broken down into several parts.
First, finding the corresponding inspiration. Voxel art seems to be a growing trend in the 3D art community lately, and it consequently was easy to find good looking references on Behance to get a feel for how voxel spaces could look like in VR. More specifically, we took inspiration from some of the works from [this artist on Behance](https://www.behance.net/joannan/).

Our voxel scenes were made with VoxelMax, an iPad app. This process quickly turned out to be meticulous, as each block mattered, and there were considerbly less geometric guidance compared to other apps like Shapr3D. However, using voxels instantly gave each asset a unique gamy-feel, which ensured that things could be brought together in cohesion. Here are a few timelapses of the assets making: [Corridor scene](https://youtu.be/r7x9g2Irfsc)  |  [Lab scene](https://youtu.be/rpq_jVUein4)  |  [Space ship scene](https://youtu.be/ReEonKyajRU)


Alongside with handmade assets, we decided to also make our own characters. For that we used Blender, which turned out to be a somewhat convenient 3D asset making tool. We followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/tzt55UfljGA) to make a smooth-looking and minimal character. Once completed, it served as the foundation for other characters used in the whole game. [Here is a timelapse of how the character was made](https://youtu.be/hHOI7UXdkbA).

In reflecting on the Blender experience, a few things immediately come to mind. There was a lot to learn about the concept of vertices and how it is used to create shapes in 3D. So far, going from Shapr3D to voxels, Blender provides the best way to work with forms, and its versatility in both allowing the important and export of a variety of 3D files made a huge impact in our project workflow. But all this did not come without a cost. While it is easy to make smooth shapes in Blender, it is important to keep an eye on the statistics. At the end of our project, we realized that each character had over 200,000 vertices, which created a number of issues when rendering our project in VR. Learning from mistakes, this is definitely a crucial outcome in the asset making experience.

Developing a bit on the visuals of each character, we decided to keep things straightforward. The hologram in the first scene was a female version of the very first character we made. It does not feature any special clothing, although it was somewhat challenging to create longer hair, as it is depicted in the time-lapse below. All other characters representing the cult feature a coat also made from scratch in Blender. It was made thanks to [this four part tutorial](https://youtu.be/tOCSOWOvn9Y), which complemented nicely the expansion of our asset making skills, now featuring clothes making. [Here is a timelapse of it](https://youtu.be/4m-w6CsJbNI).

Holograph man: Good morning Inventor, do you hear me? I am an informant from the Ministry of Defense. We know you haven't been feeling well, but have you made up your mind on what to do? Are we to go with the extraterrestrials or wait for the scientists to help us out?

**CHOICE:**

Character: I haven't, I am still not sure which direction is the one I should go with.

Character: It does not matter to me, as long as some of us are able to survive.

H.M.: We need to know. We need to prepare. Let us know as soon as you do. The future of mankind lies with you. Everyone's lives are hanging on this. Everyone's.

We remain waiting for you. Don't let us down.

**Internal Monologue[sighs]:** Let me head to the lab, I need to see Joseph.

**Scene 2: Corridor**

Sounds: 
- Sad nostalgiac music

This is all main character inner monologue. 

1st Panel → I remember this. Life was so much simpler back then. 

2nd Panel → Ah yes, who could forget? The amazing inventor, I thought I could change the world. 

3rd Panel → Will my invention kill us, or will it save us from the horrors of this world? I do not know.

4th Panel → And so, the choice is now mine, the lab should be just ahead. 

---

**Scene 3: Lab**

Sounds: 

- Background Lab noises (we only have one scientist so probably no)

Joseph: Hello inventor! Thank you for making time to see me. I know the situation is pretty messy... The Earth is almost void of its resources, people are in panic, and that crazy cult is not making it any easier for you to choose which way to go.  

Joseph: But listen, all hope is not lost. Science can still save us. Follow me, I want to show you something that we have been working on recently. 

*[Walk to the plant position]*

- IF user not coming over:
    
    Joseph1: Please follow me.  
    
    Joseph2: Did you hear me? I'm here.
    

Joseph: Do you remember the hypergrowth concept I presented once at that conference? Well, It's not just a concept anymore. Please look at this.

Joseph: This is the latest progress we've had with our development. That bottle over there, that yellow substance inside it is the heart of it all. I think you should try it for yourself.  

Joseph: Do you see the yellow bottle on the table? Pick up it and pour it inside the blue container beside you. And the robot hand will do the rest for you.

- Pouring interactions
    
    Joseph1: No not this one, it's the yellow one
    
    Joseph2: Yes, the right bottle. Please pour it into the blue container beside you. 
    
    Joseph3: What are you doing? Please pour it into the blue container.
    
    Joseph4: See the blue container on the lower part of the robot hand? That's where you should pour.
    
    Joseph5: Yes, right place. Pour in the blue container and see how the tube beside you goes.
    

[Pouring interaction]

Joseph: Did you see? Does this sway your decision at all? 

CHOICE

Response1: This does call for more enthusiasm I have to be honest. 

Response2: We still don't know how many people this can save if it can save anyone at all. 

CHARACTER REACTION

Joseph: It really does, there is still hope to save our planet. 

Joseph: I understand your concern. But is there any certainty whoever you're contacting...these aliens, there is a huge possibility they just kill us all. 

Main Character**:** I think I need to clear my head, I'll go take a walk outside. I will reconsider everything. See you soon, Joseph. 

Joseph: Alright, watch out for the Cult

**Decision Scene**

Joseph: We can do this. Have faith. Inventor we should do what it takes to save our home.

**Scene4: Outside**

Sounds: 

- People screaming
- Weird Chants
- Weird Scary Music
- Spaceship decision - with response if possible

Cult Member 1: Look who it is! Our great inventor! Thank you for finally gracing us! It is finally your time to shine. Everything you have worked for. Call upon the divine ones to rescue us. 

Cult Member 2: Hey inventor look here! Look how far science has brought us! We'll all die before science comes up with anything to save yes! Call upon them! 

Cult Member 3:  The divine will come and they shall rescue us! Make the right choice. Save us! Future generations will hail you as our savior. 

Cult Member 1: Please make your choice as soon as possible. The divine can't wait that long.

**Internal Monologue:**  

I need to clear my head. My room... I need to go back to my room. 

[Scene transitions back to scene 1 where the inventor has to make her choice] 

Final Decision Scene

Cult member: what are you hesitating for? Scientists are always doing bad things. Only the divine could save us!

**Scene 5 and 6**

Main Character [Pondering]: 

Scene 5→ Was this the right choice? I wonder what will happen to us all. Still, some of us are here, that should be good enough for me. 

Scene 6 → And so on our Earth we remain. This is the safest bet, I will work with Joseph to make this place better for us all. My goal is to hand everyone a better future and not just a select few.

```

### NonHuman Audio: Background Music and co. 



## Playtesting 

We got a few of our classmates to playtest and based on that we refined and further improved our project. Here's more on what that process was like. I would like to state that this was a pretty fun experience! Note that playtesting was done when we had 3 scenes half built. Those three scenes are the Lobby, Corridor and the Lab. The basic interactions had been set up but everything at this point of the project was still pretty janky and needed bob the builder (we fixed it ;>). 

### Playtester: Professor

Citizen Kane → Newspaper montage. 

Disappearing/Appearing and have a laser sound (scale up, flash on), move towards you

Ray-cast on the holographs in the corridor, >> 

### Playtester: Rainee 

Miss Rainee stated that "The vibe check has been passed". This alludes to the aesthetics of the project being successful in portraying a science fiction setting.  

**Feedback for the Corridor**
- The shader of the holographs in the corridor makes it hard to read the text and see the picture. 
- Hand Guide, left hand teleport-er, right hand

**Feedback for the Lab**

Guiding the user around needs to work just a little bit better 

Joseph's voice needs to be higher 

Make him pause before telling us to play around by ourselves 

Fix the textures 

### Playtester: Ons 

- Door how to open
- Corridor goes away too fast
- Fixing how the doctor acts basically
- XR scene fix
- More time to read

### Playtester: Marta 

- More time to read
- Shader
- Fix the light in the lobby
- Make it more clear to user the ray-cast for the holograms


## Challenges 

Here are some of the challenges that we faced while working on this project. To say there were more than a few is an understatement.

### Technical Challenges

### Storytelling Challenges 

Our project was a very ambitious one, totally at 7 scenes that the user experiences. The challenges appeared soon after, when we realized the considerable amount of work that we had to pour into each scene to make it work in the grander scheme of the tale itself. We had to find a way to deliver a playable experience to the users taking into account our time and skill restraints. The user initially was meant to feel small and hopeless, not knowing what to decide. Instead we twisted in a way that would form a more empowered user, one that is aware of what is happening and confident of the power that they are given. 
Our focus was to have the player listen to all the different voices before making the decision. When the time comes, the user sees those same voices, reminded of the weight of the situation and that the choice is not only affecting them, but many others as well. 
A compromise we had to make lies in the fact that our original characters were a bit too much for the oculus to handle (we ran into a preformance issue), this made us decide to lower the amount of NPCs that we have, only keeping those that were crucial to the story line. In the outside scene for example (we would have loved to have more screaming people), we had to significantly reduce the crowd size. 
Another storytelling challenge also came with the two ending scenes, we already had built so many interactions so the question was: do we add more interactions? or do we leave space for the user to contemplate? We chose the latter, due to the lack of time and to try to have open ended scenes where the user can find themselves imagining what the consequences of their choices will be.

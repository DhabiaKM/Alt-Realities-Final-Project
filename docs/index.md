# Faith (in)Humanity Documentation 


## Our Inspiration and Initial Idea

Our project is inspired by the popular science fiction novel *The Three-Body Problem*, its plot focuses on extraterrestrial forces that are trying to destroy Earth. Our take on it, however, was not to replicate the storyline nor the idea itself but rather zoom into the people aspect of the story. In our alternate reality, humanity is faced with an extreme 

How would different people react to the realization that everything that they once knew might just collapse? Some people will try to presist and fight the idea that 

We didn't replicate that story, rather we found that people's different reactions to doomsday interesting. Some people are calm and trying to find solutions, some people are in panic and some people are even worshiping the aliens. To dramatize the story, we want to showcase various interests of the group and present to the user the important decision to make that would determine the fate of humankind. 


## Scenes

Our project has 7 scenes in total, each scene is crucial to the 

### Scene 1 - The Lobby 

### Scene 2 - The Corridor 

### Scene 3 - The Lab 

### Scene 4 - The Outside 

### Scene 5 - The Lobby 

### Scene 6 - Spaceship Ending 

### Scene 7 - Outside Ending 

## Visuals 



## Process 



## Playtesting 

I got a few of our classmates to playtest and based on that we refined and further improved our project. Here's more on what that process was like. I would like to state that this was a pretty fun experience! Note that playtesting was done when we had 3 scenes half built. Those three scenes are the Lobby, Corridor and the Lab. The basic interactions had been set up but everything at this point of the project was still pretty janky and needed bob the builder (we fixed it ;>). 

### Playtester: Professor

Citizen Kane → Newspaper montage. 

Disappearing/Appearing and have a laser sound (scale up, flash on), move towards you

Ray-cast on the holographs in the corridor, >> 

### Playtester: Rainee 

Miss Rainee stated that "The vibe check has been passed". This alludes to the aesthetics of the project being successful in portraying a science fiction setting.  

**Feedback for the Corridor**
- The shader of the holographs in the corridor makes it hard to read the text and see the picture. 
- Hand Guide, left hand teleport-er, right hand

**Feedback for the Lab**

Guiding the user around needs to work just a little bit better 

Joseph's voice needs to be higher 

Make him pause before telling us to play around by ourselves 

Fix the textures 

### Playtester: Ons

- Door how to open
- Corridor goes away too fast
- Fixing how the doctor acts basically
- XR scene fix
- More time to read

### Playtester: Marta 

- More time to read
- Shader
- Fix the light in the lobby
- Make it more clear to user the raycast for the holograms


## Challenges 

Here are some of the challanges that we faced while working on this project. To say there were more than a few is an understatement.

### Technical Challenges

### Storytelling
